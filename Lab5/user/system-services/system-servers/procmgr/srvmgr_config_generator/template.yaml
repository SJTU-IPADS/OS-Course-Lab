# If you want to add a configurable server, you need to add a file as the example below, 
# and add the file name with chcore_add_configurable_server in the CMakeLists.txt file.
CHCORE_CONFIG:
  filename: "name"
  conditions:
    - - "condition1"
      - "condition2"
    - - "condition2"
  services:
    - name: "service1":
      conditions: 
        - - "condition1"
          - "condition2"
    - name: "service2":
      conditions:
        - - "condition1"
  boot_time: "eager"/"lazy"
  registration_method: "active"/"passive"

#  The value in conditions or under service name means the configure that the service depends on. 
#  If the value is empty, it means the service does not depend on any configure.
#  Each item in the top-level list must satisfy all conditions (AND relationship).
#  Each Config in the second-level list of each item only needs to satisfy one of them (OR relationship).


# If you want to add a non-configrable server as a system server, you need to add a file as the 
# example below, and add the file name with chcore_add_user_server in the CMakeLists.txt file.
